# Access OptiToken portfolio and balances

## Installation

### Requirements

NodeJS

### Instructions

After setting up NodeJS in your system, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/optitokener/opti-stats.git

```

Then run the **data.js** file:

```
node data.js
```

You should be able to see live information regarding the OPTI portfolio on Bitfinex with amounts, currencies and their values in USD and BTC, as well as the type of exchange.

**IMPORTANT:** This will only work if you have the correct API keys for OPTI on Bitfinex. Contact the OPTI Team in case you are interested in developing your own integrations. We would like to offer the API keys freely, but due to throttling (on Bitfinex side) issues that may occur by massive use, we are forced to limit the access.
